# Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm excited to explore a vast array of topics and provide data driven insights through statistical analysis and machine learning algorithms. 

Data science is a tool that has the opportunity to answer complex questions and provide actionable insights. I am always learning and developing new skills with the hope of contributing exciting interpretations. 

As I progress and complete new personal projects, I will be removing previous projects from my public repository.

Current project list:
- Chicago Airbnb Analysis: Exploring Airbnb listings and using NLP, K-Means Clustering, and feature engineering to model daily prices and monthly availability.
- Resume and Job Post Scanner Tool: Web scraping and PDF reading to keyword and key phrase extract job posts and resumes and provide a similarity score.
- 1M USDPLN Forecasting Application: An automated approach to multivariate time series forecasting of 1M USDPLN FX rates, using APIs and JSON get requests.
- The Green Card - A pathway to living and working in the U.S. (2014-2021): Applying feature engineering, data preprocessing, and statistical analysis to identify employment immigration trends.
- Illinois Mortgage Acceptance (2021): Using natural language preprocessing, feature engineering, and data cleansing to gain statistical insights into mortgage loan applications.




All projects were completed on my own time, with my own resources, and using publicly available information.

Feel free to explore my repository!
