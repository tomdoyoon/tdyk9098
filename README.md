# Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm excited to explore a vast array of topics and to provide insights through statistical analysis and machine learning algorithims. 

I believe there is always room for growth and improvement. Data science is a tool that has the opportunity to answer difficult questions and explore controversial topics. I am always learning and developing new skills with the hope of contributing to answering some of society’s questions. 

As I progress and complete new projects, I will be removing previous projects from my public repository.

Most updated project list:
- Illinois Mortgage Acceptance: Learning about successful home ownership in Illinois (2021) using natural language preprocessing, feature engineering, and data cleansing to apply statistical analysis and machine learning algorithms.
- The Green Card: Using statistical analysis, natural language preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning models, among others, to learn more about permanent immigration through employment (2014-2021).

Feel free to explore my projects!
