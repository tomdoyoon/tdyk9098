# Welcome to my GitHub!

My name is Tom and I am facinated by what data analytics and data science can achieve. 

I'm excited to explore a vast array of topics and to provide insights through statistical analysis and machine learning algorithims.

I started on my Python journey in Late March / Early April of 2022. As I progress and complete new projects, I will be removing previous projects from my public repository.

Most updated project list:
- Illinois Mortgage Acceptance
- The Green Card:

Feel free to explore my projects!
