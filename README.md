# Welcome to my GitHub!

My name is Tom and I am facinated by what data analytics and data science can achieve. I'm excited to contribute to answering a vast array of questions and providing insights through 
learning a variety of coding languages.

I started on my data science journey by diving into Python in late March / early April of 2022.

I will use this GitHub as both a personal portfolio but also a journal to document my progress and experience through data science.

# These are the types of repositories I will upload:

- Showcase: Quick and simple demonstration and journal of my learning, usually with one dataset, and no observations noted.
- MiniProject: Slightly more detailed analysis of a dataset and a list of observations.
- Project: In-depth analysis of a dataset with a final report summarizing, among other things, key findings, methods and procedures, and figures and tables.

# I hope you enjoy following along my personal journey!
