# Welcome to my GitHub!

My name is Tom and I am facinated by what data analytics and data science can achieve. 

I'm excited to explore a vast array of topics and to provide insights through statistical analysis and machine learning algorithims.

I started on my Python journey in late March / early April of 2022, and as I progress and complete new projects, I will be removing previous projects from my public repository.

Most updated project list:
- Illinois Mortgage Acceptance
      Learning about successful home ownership in Illinois (2021) using natural language preprocessing, feature engineering, and data cleansing to apply statistical analysis and machine learning algorithms.
- The Green Card:
      Using statistical analysis, natural language preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning models, among others, to learn more about permanent immigration through employment (2014-2021).

Feel free to explore my projects!
