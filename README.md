# Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm excited to explore a vast array of topics and provide data driven insights through statistical analysis and machine learning algorithms. 

I believe there is always room for growth and improvement. Data science is a tool that has the opportunity to answer difficult questions and explore complex topics. I am always learning and developing new skills with the hope of contributing to answering some of society’s questions. 

As I progress and complete new personal projects, I will be removing previous projects from my public repository.

Current project list:
- Illinois Mortgage Acceptance (September 2022): Learning about successful home ownership in Illinois (2021) using natural language preprocessing, feature engineering, and data cleansing to apply statistical analysis and machine learning algorithms.
- The Green Card (August 2022): Using statistical analysis, natural language preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning models, among others, to learn more about permanent immigration through employment (2014-2021).


All projects were completed on my own time, with my own resources, and using publicly available information.

Feel free to explore my repository!
