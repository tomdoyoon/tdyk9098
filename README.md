# Welcome to my GitHub!

I am dedicated to exploring a wide range of subjects and harnessing the power of data to provide insightful answers through statistical analysis, exploratory data techniques, and the precision of machine learning algorithms. In the world of data science, every project is an opportunity to tackle complex questions and transform them into actionable insights.

I am committed to continuous learning and skill development, always seeking to contribute valuable interpretations and solutions. 

As I move forward and complete new personal projects, I will occasionally archive previous ones from this public repository.



Current project list:
- Animated Time Series Visualization: Using animated data visualization to compare and analyze stock market crashes and weekly cumulative asset performances.
- Chicago Airbnb Analysis: Exploring Airbnb listings and using NLP, K-Means Clustering, data visualization and feature engineering to model daily prices and monthly availability.
- Resume and Job Post Scanner Tool: Web scraping and PDF reading to keyword and key phrase extract job posts and resumes and provide a similarity score.
- Automated Financial Market Research and Analysis: Multivariate time series forecasting tool and a currency strength market scanner using APIs and JSON get requests.
- The Green Card - A pathway to living and working in the U.S. (2014-2021): Applying feature engineering, data preprocessing, and statistical analysis to identify employment immigration trends.
- Illinois Mortgage Acceptance (2021): Using natural language preprocessing, feature engineering, and data cleansing to gain statistical insights into mortgage loan applications.




All projects were completed on my own time, with my own resources, and using publicly available information.
