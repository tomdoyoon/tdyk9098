# Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm excited to explore a vast array of topics and provide data driven insights through statistical analysis and machine learning algorithms. 

I believe there is always room for growth and improvement. Data science is a tool that has the opportunity to answer difficult questions and explore complex topics. I am always learning and developing new skills with the hope of contributing to answering some of society’s questions. 

As I progress and complete new personal projects, I will be removing previous projects from my public repository.

Current project list:
- The U.S. Housing Market - Conforming 30Yr Rates (1997-2022): An application of machine learning algorithms to predict 30Yr mortgage rates using cross-sectional data.
- The Green Card - A pathway to living and working in the U.S. (2014-2021): Applying feature engineering, data preprocessing, and statistical analysis to identify employment immigration trends.



All projects were completed on my own time, with my own resources, and using publicly available information.

Feel free to explore my repository!
