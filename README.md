# Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm excited to explore a vast array of topics and provide data driven insights through statistical analysis and machine learning algorithms. 

Data science is a tool that has the opportunity to answer complex questions and provide actionable insights. I am always learning and developing new skills with the hope of contributing exciting interpretations. 

As I progress and complete new personal projects, I will be removing previous projects from my public repository.

Current project list:
- Multivariate Time Series Forecasting: 30Yr Mortgage Rates: An application of deep learning algorithms to predict 30Yr mortgage rates using time-series data.
- The Green Card - A pathway to living and working in the U.S. (2014-2021): Applying feature engineering, data preprocessing, and statistical analysis to identify employment immigration trends.
- Illinois Mortgage Acceptance: Learning about successful home ownership in Illinois (2021) using natural language preprocessing, feature engineering, and data cleansing to apply statistical analysis and machine learning algorithms.




All projects were completed on my own time, with my own resources, and using publicly available information.

Feel free to explore my repository!
